## 📌 Project Overview

Quick commerce platforms operate in a highly time-critical and dynamic environment. This project evaluates how various Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models can be applied to such platforms, using Blinkit as a case study.

The report compares the following SDLC models:
- Waterfall Model  
- Incremental Development Model  
- Boehm’s Spiral Model  

The study also discusses requirements engineering, Agile and DevOps practices, ethical considerations, and emerging technologies relevant to quick commerce systems.
